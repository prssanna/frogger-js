# frogger-js

## Description :
This is the third project of the Udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree.
It is my version of the classic arcade game, Frogger.

## How to play :
To play this game run the index.html file on your browser.

### Instructions:
Your character, the girl with the kitten cap, is initially positioned on 
the grass. Using the arrow keys you have to move the girl to the water, avoiding collision with the enemy bugs. Each time this is accomplished your score is incremented by 1 point and the girl starts from the grass again. Incase of collision the girl's position and your score is reset. As your score increases the speed of the bugs increases as well.
Try achieving the highest score possible!
